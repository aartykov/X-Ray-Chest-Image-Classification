# Description

In this project, I tried to solve the problem of medical image classification with deep learning approach. Given x-ray chest images of healthy and patients with various illnesses, such as pnemonia, sars, covid-19, and streptococcus, I tried to develop a neural network that classifies the images with high accuracy. Along with the image classification problem I had to deal with the class imbalance problem, since each class contained different number of images.  

This project is about X-ray chest image classification with a deep neural network.
