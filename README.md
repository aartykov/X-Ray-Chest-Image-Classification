# Description

In this project, I tried to solve the problem of medical image classification with deep learning approach. Given x-ray chest images of healthy and patients with various illnesses, such as pnemonia, sars, covid-19, and streptococcus, I tried to develop a neural network architecture that classifies the images with high accuracy. As it is seen on the table below, along with the image classification problem I had to deal with the class imbalance problem, since each class contained different number of images.

In this project, I followed three different approaches. First, I created my own architecture and trained it from scratch. Then I adopted transfer learning method and adapted pre-trained ResNet and InceptionNet architectures to my problem. Some of the training images are given as follows,
